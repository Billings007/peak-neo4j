"GEO","320","Watershed Hydrology","http://collegeofidaho.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/Undergraduate-Catalog/Courses/GEO-Geoscience/300/GEO-320","This course provides an introduction to hydrologic processes with focus on how landscape characteristics (including human modifications) and weather influence the transformation and movement of water on the Earth's surface. Investigation across natural and disturbed watersheds and stream networks include the following topics: rainfall and runoff processes, evaporation, precipitation, infiltration, flow through porous media, overland flow, ground water contamination, and water supply. Linking watershed form and land use practices to hydrological, ecological, and biogeochemical function are important themes. Prerequisites: One of the following: ENV-160 Environmental Science I, CHE-141 General Chemistry I, PHY-231 General Physics I, or GEO-101 Physical Geology",3,3,"GEO320"
"GEO","410","Geomorphology","http://collegeofidaho.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/Undergraduate-Catalog/Courses/GEO-Geoscience/400/GEO-410","This course investigates the interactions between surface processes and landforms at a variety of temporal and spatial scales. A systems approach is used to investigate how endogenic processes (originating within the earth) and exogenic processes (occurring at the earth atmosphere ocean interface) interact to create landforms. Topics cover geomorphological theories, weathering, slope processes, soil erosion, fluvial and glacial processes and landforms, mountain building, rates of landscape change, and megafloods. Highlighted applications focus on interactions of landform processes and human activity (directly through land-use change and indirectly through climate change) and the role of geomorphic process studies in environmental planning.  Corequisites: GEO-410L Prerequisites: GEO-101, GEO-320 or GEO-310",3,3,"GEO410"
"GEO","410L","Geomorphology Laboratory","http://collegeofidaho.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/Undergraduate-Catalog/Courses/GEO-Geoscience/400/GEO-410L","The lab component of this course investigates the interactions between surface processes and landforms through field measurements and laboratory analysis. Methods of geomorphological analysis, topographic map interpretation, and aerial photo interpretation are used to further develop topics covered in lecture: weathering, slope processes, soil erosion, fluvial and glacial processes and landforms, mountain building, rates of landscape change, and megafloods. Analyses of surface processes and landforms focus on field examples within Idaho and the Pacific Northwest. Corequsite: GEO-410",1,1,"GEO410L"
